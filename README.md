# This project has been abandoned and will no longer be updated.

## History
- VK (vkontakte - ʳussian analogue of Facebook) was the most popular social network in Ukraine.
- In 2017, the biggest ʳussian websites, including VK, were blocked in Ukraine.
- Most Ukrainians immediately migrated to other social networks and messaging apps, but some decided to stay on VK.
- This project was created to maintain contact with them.

## About the Project

This is a NodeJS application that uses the VK API and the Telegram Bots API to forward messages (including images, voice messages, stickers, and files) from VK to Telegram and vice versa.

The idea behind the project is to host it outside of Ukraine to avoid the need for a VPN (as VK does not work in Ukraine without a VPN), ensuring that messages from those still using VK are not missed.

## How to Run It

Since this project is abandoned and most likely no longer functional, there is no reason to provide instructions on how to run it. This repository now serves as a historical artifact.
